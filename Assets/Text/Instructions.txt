It is your responsibility to record only when prompted.

Instructions:
- Record only when you see the phrase "So Sally..." until the text stops to get points.
- Do not record when you do not see the phrase "So Sally..." or you will lose points!

Controls:
- Left arrow key or A to move left
- Right arrow key or D to move right
- Space key or click while on the Record button to start/stop recording

Good luck!
